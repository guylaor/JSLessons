We are going to implement bubble sort -
(for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/Sorting/Bubble_sort )

This will consist of multiple passes, meaning we loop through the list for length -1 times. 
in each pass we loop through the length of the array and check each value and the one after it, if the value is bigger than the one 
after it we swap their places. 
meaning, for example: array is x= [2,1,3];
x[0] is 2, x[1] is 1
2 is bigger than 1
therefore - swap the positions of x[0] and x[1] 
after one pass the biggest element will be the last, but the list is still not completly sorted. So we need to do this pass again and again
until the whole list is sorted

end result should be:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 9, 15, 18, 32, 50, 76]
